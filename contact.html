                <li> EGR102 EV3 Robot  </li>
                <p> I programmed movement for the robot to correspond to a remote control properly. 
                    I also constructed the gearbox for the motor, and 3-D printed pieces to attach to the robot.
                </p>
                
                <li> Data Sorting and Analysis (Java, Python) </li>
                <p> I have created programs which read files and access the data from the files. I can have the program parse 
                through the file to achieve certain goals such as removing, sorting, finding, and adding data to the files.
                </p>

                <li> Simple Computer Game  (Java)</li>
                <p>Using java, I programmed a simple game which involved different pixelated "critters" which infect other
                    "critters" to become its own kind. The game loops until there is only one type remaining.

                <li> Chessboard Server Creation (C++) </li>
                <p>I have created a chessboard server which can be used by two different people on the same server to play a game of chess.
                </p>
            
                <li> OS Server Creation (C++) </li>
                <p>Using terminal commands, I have constructed multiple servers which can interact with each other 
                fluidly and without error.
